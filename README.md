Predicted Dust SEDs for JWST's Little Red Dots
1-Jul-2024

Here I provide the average UV through radio spectral energy distributions predicted for the LRD population from Casey et al. (2024), Figure 2.  There are two SEDs: one predicting the emission is due to AGN and one that it is due to star-formation.
