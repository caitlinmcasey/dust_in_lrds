Predicted Dust SEDs for JWST's Little Red Dots
1-Jul-2024

Here are the average UV through radio spectral energy distributions predicted for the LRD population from Casey et al. (2024), Figure 2.  There are two SEDs: one predicting the emission is due to AGN and one that it is due to star-formation.  Wavelength is given as log10 of rest-frame wavelength in microns.  Flux density is log10 Fnu in mJy.  Email with questions.
